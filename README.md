This is an OpenClassrooms student project. The objective is to create a software program working offline for a chess club. So we can create and run a tournament (rounds, matches, players), create players and update ranking and create reports. The operation of the tournament is done according to a Swiss tournament algorithm. Data backup and recovery are done via TinyDB.
